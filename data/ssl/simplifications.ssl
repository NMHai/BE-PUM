# Desc: This file contains simplification rules for expressions.
#
# The matching is really simple, no commutativity is checked. So
# every combination that shows up in practice must be listed explicitly.
# This helps avoiding some redundant checks for all operand orderings.
#
# The bit widths are ignored for now, so that they can be inferred when 
# the bindings are substituted in the simplified expression.

# Jakstab's native operators:
# =, <, <=, <u, <=u, +, &, |, ^, +, unary -
